Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feelin'
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'
Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'
Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feelin'
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'
Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'
Past lives couldn't ever hold me down
Lost love is sweeter when it's finally found
I've got the strangest feelin'
This isn't our first time around
Past lives couldn't ever come between us
Sometimes the dreamers finally wake up
Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'
Don't wake me, I'm not dreamin'
